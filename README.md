Welcome to your comic book collector.  This Program will allow you to keep an accurate inventory to your beloved comic book collection.
You can sort your comic inventory by publisher, date, title, or condition.  This program will help you from accidentally 
pushcasing duplicates.  If and when you decide to sell your stash on ebay, you will have an accurate account of your collection
at your fingertips.  It will easily allow insurances and auction houses appraise your collection.  
WARNING: The value for your comics may or may not be equal to the total. Though your comics may be worth 1000.00 if you were to go to a comic shop
they may offer you half, because they have to turn a profit.  The market for comics is very unpredictable, sell and invest wisely.

Enjoy this program so you can have more time to enjoy your comics.
